# NeuralDoc AI — Production-Ready RAG SaaS Platform

🚀 Live Demo: [Your Deployment Link Here]  
🐳 Dockerized | 🔐 JWT Secured | ☁ Pinecone Integrated | 🤖 Multi-LLM Support  

---

## 📌 Overview

NeuralDoc AI is a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that enables users to upload documents and query them using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Unlike basic RAG demos, this system is designed with real-world engineering principles including:

- Service-layer architecture
- LLM provider abstraction
- Cloud vector database integration
- Authentication
- Dockerized deployment
- Observability tracking

This project simulates a real SaaS AI backend system.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Large Language Models:

- Hallucinate without context
- Cannot access private documents
- Lack retrieval memory
- Are not production-secure by default

Most student RAG projects:
- Use global variables
- Lack authentication
- Do not scale
- Are not deployable
- Have no system design thinking

NeuralDoc AI solves these problems by providing a modular, secure, scalable RAG backend system.

## 🏗 System Architecture

Key Design Decisions:

- Service layer removes global state
- LLM abstraction allows provider switching via environment variables
- Cloud vector database supports scaling
- JWT authentication protects endpoints
- Docker ensures deployment consistency

- No hardcoded secrets

---

## 📈 Version Evolution

| Version | Feature |
|----------|----------|
| v1.0 | Core RAG implementation |
| v1.1 | Observability with MLflow |
| v2.0 | Persistent FAISS storage |
| v2.1 | Service layer refactor |
| v3 | LLM abstraction layer |
| v4 | Pinecone cloud integration |
| v5 | JWT authentication |

This project evolved incrementally using feature branches and pull request workflow.

## ⚖️ Local vs Production Strategy

| Component | Local | Production |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| LLM | Ollama | Groq / Gemini |
| Vector DB | FAISS | Pinecone |
| Deployment | Localhost | Docker Cloud Deploy |

This separation ensures development flexibility and production scalability.

---

## 📊 Scaling Considerations

- Stateless backend design
- External vector DB scaling
- Provider abstraction allows LLM switching
- Docker-ready for horizontal scaling
- Authentication supports multi-user extension
